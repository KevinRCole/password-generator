## March 12, 2022

This is a UW Coding Bootcamp project that required me to complete javascript starter code to create a function that generates a password from characters selected at random from an array.  The function creates the array of character from input by the user in response to javascript prompts that inform the user of relevant paramters.  The user is required to input the number and type of characters to use to generate a password.  I completed this project March 12, 2022.

## Description

In this project, I wrote a javascript function that prompts a user to input paramaters for a new password.  The function then analyzes and manipulates the user input to create a password generated by selecting characters from an array at random.  The function also detects when the user's input fall outside of the required paramaters, such as when a user requests a password that is shorter or longer than the function specifies it should be.

A user calls the function, and provides user input, via an interactive website that was created by UW Bootcamp, using HTML CSS.

My motivation and reason for doing this project was to learn how to use javascript to interact with a user in a manner that retrieves input in order to create useful output -- output that it would be very difficult if not impossible for the user to generate on his/her/their own without the help of a computer.

## Credits

In writing this javascript function, I relied on information I learned in UW Bootcamp, including help from my instructor, and information contained in UW Bootcamp's instructional materials.  I also relied on help from UWBootcamp teaching assistants, a UWBootcamp tutor, and inforamtion from numersous sources on the web, including but not limited to sources that UWBootcamp referred me to.  UWBootcamp provided me with all the HTML CSS code to support this project, plus javascript starter code.
