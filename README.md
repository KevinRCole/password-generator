This is a UW Coding Bootcamp project that required me to complete javascript starter code to create a function that generates a password from characters selected at random from an array.  The function creates the array of character from input by the user in response to javascript prompts that inform the user of relevant paramters.  The user is required to input the number and type of characters in the array, subject to paramaters set by the function, which the function conveys to the user via javascript prompts.  I completed this project March 12, 2022.

## Description

In this project, I wrote a javascript function that prompts a user to input paramaters for a new password.  The function then analyzes and manipulates the user input to create a password generated by selecting characters from an array at random.  The function also detects when the user's input fall outside of the required paramaters, such when a user requests a password that is shorter or longer than the function specifies it should be.

My motivation and reason for doing this project was to learn how to use javascript to interact with a user in a manner that retrieves input in ordedr to create useful output -- output that it would be very difficult if not impossible for the user to generate on his/her/theri own without the help of a computer.

## Credits

In writing this function, I relied on instructional materials provided by UWBootcamp.  I also relied on help from UWBootcamp teaching assistances, and a UWBootcamp tutor, and inoforamtion I found on the web, from numerous sources, including but not limited to informational sourches that UWBootcamp referred me to.  UWBootcamp provided me with all the HTML CSS code to support this project, plus javascript starter code.
